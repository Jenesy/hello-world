# hello-world
First repository for cs50 course

Hello everyone, I call myself Jenesy. 
I would very much like to get into the world of Computer Science, since it is a never ending learning curve and
has a lot of challances I like to take on. 
Hope everyone will succeed this course I am taking, cs50 by Harvard. 
Started it before, but I will take it as long as it takes to finish, 
cause I found the first time round, I learned so much I kept using throughout the year.
Really hope to finish it this time and lots of gratitude to everyone working so hard to make it succeed. Thank you.

Kind regards,

Jenesy
